# Seoul_Bike_Duration_Prediction_ML

This project is implemented in Python and gathers tasks of :
- Data visualisation : show correlations between the data and the target on the Jupyter Notebook
- Machine learning algorithm modelisation on the Jupyter Notebook
- Transformation of the model into an API Flask

You can check below the result of the deployment of our Machine Learning model : LGBM(Light Gradient Regressor) which had the best score among the models.
